```

## Quick start (local)

- Frontend (Next.js):
  - cd frontend
  - Install deps: pnpm i (or npm i)
  - Dev: pnpm dev (or npm run dev)

- Backend (Flask):
  - cd backend
  - python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
  - pip install -r requirements.txt
  - python app.py (exposes http://localhost:5000)

## Docker (optional)

Run both services via Docker:

```
docker compose up --build
```

This will start:
- backend: http://localhost:5000/
